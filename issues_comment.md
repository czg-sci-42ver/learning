- it turns out the `vscode-R` make the workspace detection, I know it by toggling the `Developer tool` in the **vscode**
    ```json
    [Extension Host] [updateRequest] Ignored request outside workspace
    ```
- Despite it can be tweaked to enable show in `？` result outside the vscode workspace， but it may lose the ability of `httpgd` to see **syntaxhighlighting and hyperlink jumping**，etc
- so just use `radian` in the vscode， it is fantastic :smile:!
